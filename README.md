CHAOS GIFs

#Window Load
Dynamically creates a set of 10 "chaos buttons" from a prepopulated array.

#"Chaos Button" On-click
Runs a function that uses a GIPHY API to retrieve 10 GIFs (of any rating) with the chaos button text as the search term. Create <img> elements inside <div> elements and appends those a <div> at the bottom of the page. Each time a "chaos button" is pressed, the old <div> and <img> elements are erased and new ones added instead.

#"Make Chaos" Form Submission
Quite simply, this adds a new chaos button to set at the top of the page. The button will be automatically sorted into the array in alphabetical order and its text will be in ALL CAPS.
